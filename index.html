        Labrador retrievers are a breed of medium to large sized gun dog. They
        are friendly, energetic, and playful. Labradors were originally bred as
        working dogs, used for sporting and hunting, and due to their easy
        nature are often trained as guide dogs 🐕‍🦺. Labradors are also widely
        kept as pets and were ranked as the #1 most popular breed of UK pet in
        2022 (

        dogs and with the right motivation (🍖🥓🥩) can be straightforward to
        train.

      <h3>Do you have what it takes to be a pet owner?</h3>
      <p>
        If you are serious about finding a new life-long companion you need to
        know how to care for them! Dogs are big commitments, and Labradors
        typically live for up to 12 years. A dog might only make up part of your
        lifetime, but to them, you are their whole world.

        on how to prepare for your new friend.

      <h3>Adopt or Shop?</h3>
      <p>
        The last step in your journey to dog ownership is deciding where to find
        your new four-legged friend. You generally have two options; adopt a dog
        from a rescue centre or buy a new puppy.
      </p>
      <h4>Adoption</h4>
      <p>
        Adopting a dog can be a very fulfilling and selfless deed, giving a dog
        a chance at a new happy life. Adopting a dog can also be beneficial as
        if you adopt an older dog, you know exactly what you are getting. Many
        have already had lots of training (no more sleepless nights letting your
        new pup out every 2 hours!). Many rescue dogs are happy to live in
        families and with other pets, and you are often saving them from a life
        in a soulless kennel, or worse euthanasia. However, there can be some
        downsides: depending on their upbringing, some rescues come with
        behavioural issues which may need time, work, and money to help them
        overcome these problems *.
      </p>

      <h4>Buying a Puppy</h4>
      <p>
        Buying a puppy gives you that exciting new puppy feeling (and that new
        puppy smell), however buying a new dog can be hard work, puppies need
        constant attention, letting out every couple of hours, and lots of
        training. If you work a 9-5 a puppy is probably not the right option for
        you! However, if you do have the time to dedicate to raising a new
        puppy, it can be rewarding, and you really get the opportunity to shape
        your new companion 🐾.
